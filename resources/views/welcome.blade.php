                My name is Andy McDonald. I am a software engineer with a particular interest in back end web development using frameworks such as Laravel. I have recently completed my third year at the University of the Highlands and Islands, achieving a BSc in Computing (Software Engineering) with a distinction, and I am currently in 4th year on course to achieve my honours.

                To be perfectly honest, I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do with my life until the COVID pandemic hit in 2020 and I finally took the plunge to apply to university to study computing. Since then, I have discovered a passion hidden away in my tendency to tinker, perfect and explore computer systems my entire life: Software Engineering.
